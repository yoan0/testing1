    <h1>I am a H1 Heading</h1>
    <p>Hello World. I am a simple paragraph.</p>
    <!-- Delete the src attribute so that the image can't be found
    <p>I am another paragraph, but I contain an image that has a picture of Tim Berners-Lee in it. The image tag is an
        <strong>empty</strong> tag with a <code>src</code> attribute where the source of the image is specified and an
        <code>alt</code> attribute where an <strong>alternative</strong> description is placed should the image not be
        viewable <img src='app/img/TBL2012.png'
            alt='Sir Tim Berners-Lee on stage at the 2012 Olymic Games Opening Ceremony' />. If it is not obvious, the
        image is an <strong>inline</strong> element and moves along with the text inside this paragraph and creates a
        lot of space between the line that it is on and the line above it.</p>
